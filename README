= Audio Player

This extension for Radiant adds a Flash audio player plugin which can be embedded on the pages of your site. It adds an "Audio" tab to the admin area, where mp3 files may be uploaded.


=== Installing for Radiant 0.6.9+

In a terminal, <tt>cd</tt> to the root directory of your Radiant site. Run the following command:

  script/extension install audio_player

Continue by running the rake tasks (see below).

=== Installing for Radiant pre-0.6.9

This extension is hosted on github. If you have git installed, then <tt>cd</tt> to the root of your radiant project and issue this command: 

  git clone git://github.com/nelstrom/radiant-audio_player-extension.git vendor/extensions/audio_player

If you donâ€™t have git, then you can instead download the tarball from this URL:

  http://github.com/nelstrom/radiant-audio_player-extension/tarball/master

and expand the contents to <tt>your-radiant-project/vendor/extensions/audio_player</tt>.

=== Migrate and copy assets into your app

From your radiant application root run the install task:

  rake (production) radiant:extensions:audio_player:install
  
  # OR you can run these three tasks in succession:
  rake radiant:extensions:audio_player:create_config_file
  rake radiant:extensions:audio_player:update
  rake (production) radiant:extensions:audio_player:migrate

Restart your server, and you should find that an "Audio" tab has been added to the admin area.
